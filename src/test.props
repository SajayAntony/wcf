<!-- Handles the test output directory issue for visual studio. Currently we need to do a full build from the command line first.
     But once - dotnet/buildtools#181 is fixed we might be able to get rid of this. 
     This property walks up the tree and finds the buildtools computed $(bindir) and $(TestPath)\$(DebugTestFrameworkFolder)
     and sets the output path to match the start working directory.
     Currently handles only Windows_NT as the OS_GROUP
